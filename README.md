## How to install

Requires **Stylus addon** for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or 
 [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en).

Tested on Desktop, Firefox, best for 1000px wide and up.


## Purpose

The main focus is *readability* of the mod pages.

In general:

- Site-wide compact header / top navigation
- Slightly darker theme, so images and text pop better


Mod pages:

- DESCRIPTION tab:
  - option to disable the centered content (easier to read)
  - limit the line length on wide desktop (easier to read)
- FILES tab:
  * auto-expand all the files, so "Misc" file descriptions can be seen
  * simplify the NMM / MANUAL download buttons
- IMAGES tab:
  * remove the awful gradient, so the images look brighter
- POSTS tab:
  * mostly aesthetic tweaks
- Fix lack of contrast or emphasis in some areas, for example:
  * visually separate the mod tags from the main buttons
- Fix unnecessary repetition in some places, for example:
  * "Mod tags" label next to what are obviously tags
  * mod title at the end of the breadcrumb, just above the... mod title
- Simplify by unifying some background / boxes so it's easier to scan
